<h1>KCMS</h1>
<p>KCMS is a simple Content Management System. If you want to know more about the idea behind it, look at the page in the <a href="https://github.com/KKreibich/kcms/wiki">Wiki</a></p>
<p>As I just started working on this project, nothing is really working. If you see something in
the existing code, which could be done better, feel free to fork and change it or to write me an e-mail
with the idea.</p>
