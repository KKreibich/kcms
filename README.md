<h1>KCMS</h1>
<p>KCMS is a simple Content Management System. It's mainly developed for Kilian-Kreibich.de</p>
<p>As I just started working on this project, nothing is really working. If you see something in
the existing code, which could be done better, feel free to fork and change it or to write me an e-mail
with the idea.</p>
