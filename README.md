<p>With KCMS we want to create a simple content management system, which offers only the essential functions but is very open for costumizing with themes and plugins.</p><p>
At the moment we do not have a working version as we are still programming the fundamental system.</p>

<h2>Getting involved</h2>
<p>If you want to support us you can take a look at the code, fork and improve it. I'll try to review pull-requests as fast as possible.</p><p>
If you're interested in helping us to develop KCMS, take a look at our Wiki and learn about where you are able to help. If you have questions, you can contact me via e-mail.</p>

<h2>Plugin & theme-development</h2>
<p>For all, who want to offer plugins and themes for this system, please also take a look at the wiki, we have specific pages about plugin development. In the future, I will provide a list of themes and plugins I have reviewed and which are secure.
If you want to have your plugin in this list, send me an e-mail to kcms@kilian-kreibich.de with a link to a GitHub-repo with the code of your plugin. I'll review it and add it to the list or write you an e-mail with the problems I found. Please 
take care of the guidelines in the wiki, then there shouldn't be too many problems.</h2>
